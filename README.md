# 🎬 Movie Picker 🎬

Welcome to my Final Project from the Web Development Bootcamp from [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/). Movie Picker is the App that I build, where you and your friends who don’t know what to watch can choose a movie you all agree on instead of wasting precious hours.

#
## How does it work

 - Insert yours and your friend's names
 - For each User choose the movie genres that you would like to watch
 - Add the movie(s) that you want to watch to the watchlist
 - After all Users are done choosing the movies, *press* Results.

  In the end, the App will show the Matched Movies that you chose.
